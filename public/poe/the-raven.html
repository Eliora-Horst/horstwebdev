		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this and nothing more.”</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nameless <em>here</em> for evermore.</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This it is and nothing more.”</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely this and nothing more.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such name as “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>On the morrow <em>he</em> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br>But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>She shall press, ah, nevermore!</em>
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;<br>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>Is there—<em>is</em> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
		  	</p>
		  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, <em>still</em> is sitting<br>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be lifted—nevermore!
