	  							Coming into this lab was an interesting experience for me.  At this point in my life, I have about 8 years of coding experience under my belt, but none of it has been in markup.  In some ways, coming to learning markup from the background made the process more difficult than it may have been to another student who had no programming experience.  I have an expectation of the way code should work, and how it should function, and when that doesn’t happen, it can be frustrating.  It was mainly the little things, like how there were no reserved characters to end lines or sections (like the semicolon in languages such as Java and C++).  Overall, to my sensibilities as a computer programmer, the completed markup file felt unfinished.

	  							The only place I really got stuck was trying to get the image to load.  Although I followed the tutorial to the T, my image still wouldn’t load into a converted HTML or Word or PDF document.  Another thing that makes markup particularly frustrating to me is that I can’t debug it in the same way I would an HTML document, or even a WordPress page.  In most web development, if something is not showing up in the way that it should be, I can simply inspect the page and find where the document should be showing up and find the particular error.  In markup, there are no blatant errors.  This makes the debugging process incredibly tricky.  Because of this, I had to guess at possible solutions for my image being missing, as opposed to homing in on the problem and fixing it directly.

	  						<p>
	  							I am most curious as to how markup is most utilized in the world of digital humanities.  Is it really the efficient way to encode data?  What are the major differences between writing something is markup and converting it to a Word document, as opposed to just writing a Word document?  If someone needed a PDF, is it fast to write it in markdown, or to write it in Word or some other word processor and then convert it to PDF?  
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							I can see how it may be useful for turning a document into HTML, for someone who has no experience with HTML, but as I do, it seems like a tool I will probably not use much of in the future.  It seems most useful to those who, for one reason or another, are not entirely comfortable with pure coding.  This offers an easy and gentle entry into the world of computer programming for the public historian or the digital humanist.  It may also be more accessible – not everyone has Microsoft office, or other higher level word processors, and being able to make documents in Word without actually having Word could be very powerful indeed.
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							I would be interested in seeing projects on a much bigger scale to see how markdown as been used in a big way.  Less from the straight to Word or PDF side of things, and more on the converting into web documents side.

							<p>While I had heard of the Torn Apart/Separados project before, I had never actually seen or navigated through the project before.  On first glance, I was very impressed, both from a layman’s perspective and from the perspective of a digital humanist.  A lot of work obviously went into the project, and in creating interesting visuals to help represent the data.  However, as I started to use the site and investigate, I found a multitude of small issues.  These ranged from annoying things, like switching from Volume 1 and Volume 2 having different tools available, to downright frustrating things, like some of the visualizations being impossible to read, and some just downright not loading.</p>
							<p>From what I could gather, this project did indeed accomplish what is originally set out to do, but I feel the data it found raised many questions, which the project has the capability to address, and has not done yet.  In addition, while the visualizations were impressive, some of the interfaces could use some cleaning up.  It was very hard to understand the visual of what was happening (speaking specifically of the “RAIN” visual in Volume II).  This core of this problem probably stems from the initial timeframe they had to make the project, but it seems to me that a project with fewer but more polished visuals would have made more of an impact than the multitude of confusing visuals.</p>
							<p>As far as choice of platform, I believe that they chose correctly – having this information available online makes it easily accessible.  I do think they could do more with making more friendly to social media platforms – a cause like this could benefit immensely from being shared around, and as it is, it is very hard to use on mobile devices.  This kind of information could be very eye opening to the right people, and having the site be more accessible would lead to more people being able to explore it.</p>
							<p>Overall, most of the issues lead to a lack of transparency.  Who had made this project and why was buried in the pages.  Lack of captions on data could lead easily to misinterpretation – for example, the data set they used was from 2014-2018, yet a person could easily visit the site and assume the data shown was current.</p>
							<p>I think this project shows a great starting place for a Digital Humanities project.  It has a great structure, and honest intent that was refreshing to see.  However, in order to successful, I would have changed a few things.  One, and more important (in my opinion), is the need for clarity.  I would have decreased the amount of visualizations and focused on making maybe five of them work across all platforms and reflect the data as accurately as we could.  Front and center, I would put where the data came from and from what timeframe.  The visualization would also need more details and explanation on how to interpret the data, and what conclusions we (as the so-called professionals) drew from it.  I believe it is vitally important as Digital Humanists to be as honest and clear as possible, especially in an age when willful misinterpretation of data is rampant – whether online or in the media.</p>
