	  					I came into this lab with no foreknowledge, which made for a nice change.  Thought I have worked with JavaScript in the past, I have never worked with maps in a digital setting before.  The first one I worked with was Google Map, which I had seen utilized before online, but I had never actually delved into the tools it offered.  While I found it fun to play around with inputting different CSVs, and planning their mapping, I found the tool overall a little lacking.  I am sure there are more advanced project examples out there using custom Google Maps, but from what I could tell from my brief foray, Google Maps seems very simplistic.
	  					</p>
	  					<p>
	  					On the other hand, StoryMaps.JS seems like a very complex tool.  The examples of projects shown on their homepage were amazing, sleek, and very modern in design and UI.  Once I moved into trying my hand at creating my own map, I ran into some difficulty.  While I am sure a quick YouTube tutorial would clear up a lot of issues, I found the entry level ease of use lacking in documentation.  While some things were obvious, basic things like changing the map were not at all apparent.  This is something I have noticed with a lot of contemporary web development tools and software—they tend to be very slick, and clean, but sometimes to their detriment.  There is so much hidden behind the clean façade that it is hard to figure out what path to take to solve problems when they arise.  And there seem to be only two levels of use – either the casual user, coming to make a quick project, or the investing programmer.  There do not seem to be any tools for the middle of the road user – someone coming to the project not familiar with the tools being used, but interested in created something more complex.  To me, it speaks to a lack of foresight in their intended audience.
	  					</p>
	  					<p>
	  					Moving on to my own project for this class, my group recently realized that our project was not viable the way we had envisioned it, as census data from the years we were looking at did not include religion.  However, in the reworking of our project idea, we came up with a solution that involves using StoryMaps.JS to make our project.  It was interesting that the tool seems capable of scaling to the skill of the user – projects with minimal effort were still viable on the platform, as well as the most intense, sleek ones.  I look forward to really delving into how it works, and we can use to make a clean, professional looking final project.  I do have some background in JavaScript, so I am interested in seeing if I can do any custom tweaking on the back end without completely breaking the program.

	  							This lab was a roller coaster for me.  While I have a great deal of experience with Github, I have none with Jekyll, and I was interested in getting to know it.  However, I never really got to that stage.  The entirety of my time in the lab was spent trying to follow the instruction for all the various things we had to install, and then doing web searches every time those instructions did not work.  The installation problems ranged from the syntax not being quite right, to entire extraneous packages needing to be installed before I could install the one I needed.  After class, I finally managed to get the boilerplate Jekyll blog up and running on my localhost, so the exercise was not entire fruitless on my part.
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							I would be interesting in reading up on Jekyll and seeing what else it can do.  Is it just for blogs?  If not, what other kinds of websites can one build using it?  If blogs are the only things Jekyll is really made for, what kinds of features does it off that plain HTML and CSS do not?  Could one conceivably reconfigure the base code inside the boilerplate to create a different kind of site?  I am also interested in Ruby – it is a language I have heard great deal about (especially when I was trying to find a full time software engineer position), but I still don’t know a lot about it.  From this lab, I can see how it has different elements and methods that come together, but I would be interesting in exploring how Ruby works and what it’s best use is, especially for online applications.
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							It also came to light during this lab that the way I learned Git is not the same way many others have learned it.  When I was taught how to use Git in my coding bootcamp, we learned how to do everything from the command line – linking to a repository, pushing to and pulling from, etc.  I had a vague idea there were desktop features for Git, but I had no idea Git had such a variety of easy to use, user friendly, software that easily allows one to pull and push to their online repository from their desktop.  As I am so accustomed to using the command line, I don’t know if this will be a feature I ever really take advantage of, but I can see how it makes the whole process of ‘git-ing’ so much more welcoming to a non-programmer.  I have also never used Git for anything other than code, and it hadn’t really occurred to me to use it for any other projects.  But of course, Git is simply a version control system – what version it is controlling and what kind of data that is I presume can be anything.  I would be interested in future in trying to use Git with other (perhaps not a tech comfortable) peers, on a more humanities based project.

	  						<h5>SEPTEMBER 19</h5>
							 <p>
	  							In the Fall of 2015, I participated in a 10 week JavaScript coding bootcamp, where the final goal was to create and launch a website from scratch.  That being my background, I did not do the first lab on learning HTML, as I am already rather well versed in the language.  Instead, I moved on to the lab in reading and writing to and from files in Python.
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							While I found the basic concepts of the programming rather easy to grasp, it was an interesting exercise to attempt.  I haven’t done any sort of direct reading/writing to files since my undergrad coursework, when I worked in C++.  
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							The idea of having a program be able to directly take a file and amend it on such a basic level is of interest to me.  Obviously, text editing programs like Microsoft Word do this in a much more complicated way, with a complex front facing UI, but the core is the same.  A file is read in or created, manipulated, and then stored.  I would be interested in exploring more of the backend that use code like this – for instance, when composing documents online and storing in the cloud, how does the backend code work, to create a new, writeable document, allow the user to enter data in (text, formatting, images etc.), then when a save is performed, push that document to the cloud. 
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							It is also my understanding that Python is used a great deal in web applications.  I would be interested in exploring how Python is implemented online, and specifically if and how it is used in these kinds of user input related data writing.  From working with the brief lab, it also became apparent to me how easily (and how disastrously) one could overwrite and destroy a document by a simple executable program.  One simple typo in the filename, or accidently rewriting a file instead of making a new file could be irreversible.  In basic text editors for programming, there is no “Are you sure you want to save?” function, so it behooves the coder to be wary of what and how they are writing.  Frequent saving is a good thing, especially in coding, but one needs to be aware of how saving can completely erase previous work.  The mindful code should, when writing long, extensive code, implement checks for themselves in the backend – little reminders that the final user does not see, but that help the coder (and other coders working on the project).  Github solves some of these issue (i.e. saving previous copies of work), but that still relies on the user to remember to frequently push work out.  I wonder what software exists out there to help back-end coders with keeping a systems of checks and balances in place.

	  							Coming into this lab was an interesting experience for me.  At this point in my life, I have about 8 years of coding experience under my belt, but none of it has been in markup.  In some ways, coming to learning markup from the background made the process more difficult than it may have been to another student who had no programming experience.  I have an expectation of the way code should work, and how it should function, and when that doesn’t happen, it can be frustrating.  It was mainly the little things, like how there were no reserved characters to end lines or sections (like the semicolon in languages such as Java and C++).  Overall, to my sensibilities as a computer programmer, the completed markup file felt unfinished.
	  						</p>
	  						<div class="caption">
	  							<img src="/labs/images/html-markup.png">
	  						</div>
	  						<p id="image-padding">
	  							The only place I really got stuck was trying to get the image to load.  Although I followed the tutorial to the T, my image still wouldn’t load into a converted HTML or Word or PDF document.  Another thing that makes markup particularly frustrating to me is that I can’t debug it in the same way I would an HTML document, or even a WordPress page.  In most web development, if something is not showing up in the way that it should be, I can simply inspect the page and find where the document should be showing up and find the particular error.  In markup, there are no blatant errors.  This makes the debugging process incredibly tricky.  Because of this, I had to guess at possible solutions for my image being missing, as opposed to homing in on the problem and fixing it directly.
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							I am most curious as to how markup is most utilized in the world of digital humanities.  Is it really the efficient way to encode data?  What are the major differences between writing something is markup and converting it to a Word document, as opposed to just writing a Word document?  If someone needed a PDF, is it fast to write it in markdown, or to write it in Word or some other word processor and then convert it to PDF?  
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							I can see how it may be useful for turning a document into HTML, for someone who has no experience with HTML, but as I do, it seems like a tool I will probably not use much of in the future.  It seems most useful to those who, for one reason or another, are not entirely comfortable with pure coding.  This offers an easy and gentle entry into the world of computer programming for the public historian or the digital humanist.  It may also be more accessible – not everyone has Microsoft office, or other higher level word processors, and being able to make documents in Word without actually having Word could be very powerful indeed.
	  						</p>
	  						<p>
	  							I would be interested in seeing projects on a much bigger scale to see how markdown as been used in a big way.  Less from the straight to Word or PDF side of things, and more on the converting into web documents side.

							<p>While I had heard of the Torn Apart/Separados project before, I had never actually seen or navigated through the project before.  On first glance, I was very impressed, both from a layman’s perspective and from the perspective of a digital humanist.  A lot of work obviously went into the project, and in creating interesting visuals to help represent the data.  However, as I started to use the site and investigate, I found a multitude of small issues.  These ranged from annoying things, like switching from Volume 1 and Volume 2 having different tools available, to downright frustrating things, like some of the visualizations being impossible to read, and some just downright not loading.</p>
							<p>From what I could gather, this project did indeed accomplish what is originally set out to do, but I feel the data it found raised many questions, which the project has the capability to address, and has not done yet.  In addition, while the visualizations were impressive, some of the interfaces could use some cleaning up.  It was very hard to understand the visual of what was happening (speaking specifically of the “RAIN” visual in Volume II).  This core of this problem probably stems from the initial timeframe they had to make the project, but it seems to me that a project with fewer but more polished visuals would have made more of an impact than the multitude of confusing visuals.</p>
							<p>As far as choice of platform, I believe that they chose correctly – having this information available online makes it easily accessible.  I do think they could do more with making more friendly to social media platforms – a cause like this could benefit immensely from being shared around, and as it is, it is very hard to use on mobile devices.  This kind of information could be very eye opening to the right people, and having the site be more accessible would lead to more people being able to explore it.</p>
							<p>Overall, most of the issues lead to a lack of transparency.  Who had made this project and why was buried in the pages.  Lack of captions on data could lead easily to misinterpretation – for example, the data set they used was from 2014-2018, yet a person could easily visit the site and assume the data shown was current.</p>
							<p>I think this project shows a great starting place for a Digital Humanities project.  It has a great structure, and honest intent that was refreshing to see.  However, in order to successful, I would have changed a few things.  One, and more important (in my opinion), is the need for clarity.  I would have decreased the amount of visualizations and focused on making maybe five of them work across all platforms and reflect the data as accurately as we could.  Front and center, I would put where the data came from and from what timeframe.  The visualization would also need more details and explanation on how to interpret the data, and what conclusions we (as the so-called professionals) drew from it.  I believe it is vitally important as Digital Humanists to be as honest and clear as possible, especially in an age when willful misinterpretation of data is rampant – whether online or in the media.</p>
